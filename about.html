        <p> Hi, my Name Is Yvette.
        I first got introduced to computers when I came to America.
        The first time I was introduced to coding was In my 5th grade technology class, where we would go to this website called coding.com and complete coding games. 
        A fews years after that I took technology class in 8th grade but in that class we really never learned anything about coding. So I havenâ€™t really been into coding since 5th grade but I'm really grateful that I have this class so I can get back into it.
        I joined the refcode class because I wanted to expand my skills in coding. I want to get familar with CSS, HTML, JavaScript because in the future when I start 
       tech class I would already understand the basics of coding.</p>
